- 👋 Hi, I’m @EODMastery
- 👀 I’m interested in so many things, i'd have a book to read here. Some of them are motorcycles, gardening and farming, and technology.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to work with a CI/CD pipeline. I'm building a small WebAssembly application and deploying it to a git repo. 
     From there I want to automate docker deployments depending on the environment, but that's where I get stuck.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ... really anything!  
- 📫 How to reach me:
